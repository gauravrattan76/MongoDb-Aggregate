Cenrallised workflow-
________________________

No branches in this case

So if we change the same file and same file the. We get the error

Git pull —rebase origin master. —It will always have the initial commit and add my commit on top of that

So it will show the file where we have the error

Git status.  Shows where the conflict is

Then open git merge tool


Git mergetool

Merge. The cha gets manually and then continue rebase continue


Git rebase —continue



Git push origin master

___________________________________


When we have feature branch workflow-


All features develop t happens on feature branch not the master branch


Feature branch workflow-s

Creating a feature branch


Git branch feature 1

Git checkout feature1

Then create file
Add it to staging
Commit
Git push origin feature1


And we need to open a pull request

Base master and compare to feature

And then anyone can merge with the master branch

_______________________

checkout only if we have made some changes and revert them 
We can use git checkout file name changes are gone

We can also use the command git revert commit id and the changes are gone

_________________

So we know girt checkout git revert git reset
